It depends.

If you own a Blog, a Read or Love button should fit you. It will allow visitor to tell you he has read your article, and the number is telling you the total Readers of your article.

If you own an Online Shop, a User button will be a good choice. If I am an user of that product, then I can click "Mii +", which me I am an user as well. It will tell how popular and how many user is using the product. Of cause, a Love and Hate button is also fit for an Online Shop.

= Where should I put the MiiPlus button on my pages? =

You know your page and your users best, so we recommend putting the button wherever you think it will be the most effective. Above the fold, near the title of the page, and close to the social sharing links is often a good location. It can also be effective to place the MiiPlus button at both the end and the beginning of an article or story.

We only provide English at the moment.

= Can I place multiple buttons on a single page that all target to different URLs? =

Yes, but you'll need to edit the button code. Use the link attribute to specify the target URL.

For example, if your home page has a module linking to your shop, and you want to add a Love button to that module, edit the value of the link attribute to point to your shop's URL, like this:

<mii:plus mode="love" link="yourshopurl"></mii:plus>
